# OpenSCAD format

Can't deal with the IDE which comes with it anymore\.

Fortunately the bog\-standard knitter is more than up to the task\.


#### imports

```lua
local s = require "status:status" ()
```


## SCAD Knitter

```lua
local Scad_knit = require "orb:knit/knitter" "scad"
```

```lua
return Scad_knit
```
