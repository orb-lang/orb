*** Drawers

Drawers are matched by the number of colons on either side of the bracket.

There will be further recognition possible in the lead and tail of a drawer,
but this remains underspecified.

Plausibly, the bottom will be used primarly for categories.

-  with a list
  -  inside

:[drawer closed]:

:[another simple drawer]:
writing


:[another simple drawer]:

::[double drawer]::
-  with a list
  -  inside
  -  it
:[not a drawer]::

and some text
